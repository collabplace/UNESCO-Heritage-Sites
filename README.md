# UNESCO Heritage sites

India is a land of plentiful when it comes to travel. After visiting Hampi and Pattadakal, I got curious about UNESCO heritage sites. These are extremely well maintained compared to other tourist spots.

UNESCO classifies specific landmarks with "outstanding value to humanity" as heritage sites. India has 40 in its land.

If one were to take a driving trip to cover all sites without visting the site again, how long (in kilometers) would the route be?

It would take little under **15000 kilometers** to cover all the sites. My route starts from *Ramappa temple*, heads to southern India to Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa.
